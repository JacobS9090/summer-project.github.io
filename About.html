    <p id="simmons"> The Eastern Express was founded by several students who attended the University of Pennsylvania. Each founder had a different taste in literature.
      Due to this, the prices of books are different colors. For Carlos, the color is Orange, for Ivan the color is similar to that of pink, for Jamie the color is a Dandelion Yellow, for Mehmet the color is similar to that of Violet.
      for Austin, the color is similar to that of green. These students were a unique group of people who came from different countries and backgrounds but shared a passion for literature and music. Carlos Ruiz was one of the few students who came from Mexico, his major was in Computer Engineering but in his spare time loved to read books. Jamie Harrison was Carlos's roommate,
      although they had different majors (Jamie was in finance) they as broke college students shared their books and realized they had a common interest in literature.
      Ivan had met Carlos as they were both in the same Computer Engineering course. Ivan like Carlos was not from the United States, Ivan was from Ukraine and from Ukraine he brought his interest in e-commerce and music. Mehmet Forofa was a close friend of Jamie as they both had a finance major, Mehmet was adventurous and always willing to explore. Mehmet grew up in the beautiful city of Istanbul in Turkey, this leads him to have a city-kid mentality and he was always open to trying new foods. Austin Meng had been the guy who could be found eating out and always had loads of books in his backpack. Austin loved the city of Philly so much that he could be found in almost all Museums all over the city. The five students would usually spend their nights eating Cheesesteaks or Take Out Chinese reading and coding. Jamie had the idea of coming up with a website for only the school similar to how Facebook started, but Mehmet and Carlos wanted to take it further guaranteeing a life of Philanthropy and Wealth. To this day the five are dedicated to donating to Charity and making sure the customer is happy.
